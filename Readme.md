# AI/ML ATT&CK Framework
 
## Objective
* This work provides a comprehensive knowledge base of AI/ML specific security techniques and tools.
* AI developers and researchers can use this framework to be better informed of the potential security issues associated with the AI/ML techniques, identify appropriate mitigation strategies, and choose the tools that can carry out these offensive and defensive techniques.
 
## Method
* This framework is built on a systematic literature review, which has been performed on IEEE and ACM digital libraries, and leveraged a snowballing process to find other relevant resources. 
 
## Structure
* 1- Contains the tables that represent and characterize techniques and tools.
* 2- This file contains the framework's website, representing all the techniques and tools, definitions, and properties. 
* 3- It provides the results of the initial query performed in IEEE and ACM digital libraries, containing papers and their information. It also includes some of the documents that were studied to extract and refine the search keywords.
* 4- Represents the results of the performed inclusion and exclusion criteria on the extracted papers, as well as the initial catalog before performing the SLR.
* 5- Contains additional files that have been developed through the project.
